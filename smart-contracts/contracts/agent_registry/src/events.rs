//! # Event Types for Agent Registry
//!
//! This module defines the typed structs that are emitted as Soroban contract
//! events. Each struct corresponds to one event topic and is published via
//! `env.events().publish(topic, data)`.
//!
//! ## Topic convention
//!
//! All events share a two-symbol topic prefix:
//!
//! ```text
//! ("registry", "<action>")
//! ```
//!
//! This lets off-chain indexers filter events by contract + topic[1] without
//! needing to know every possible action in advance.
//!
//! ## Event catalogue
//!
//! | Function            | topic[1]           | Data fields                                              |

//! | `register_agent`    | `agent_registered` | `agent_id`, `owner`, `capability`, `price_stroops`       |
//! | `register_agents`   | `agent_registered` | same — one event per successfully committed agent        |
//! | `deregister_agent`  | `agent_deregistered` | `agent_id`, `owner`, `capability`                      |

//! | `resolve_errors`    | `error_resolved`   | `error_id`, `resolution` — one event per resolved error  |
//! | `pause`             | `paused`           | `()`                                                     |
//! | `unpause`           | `unpaused`         | `()`                                                     |

//! | `update_pricing`  | `price_upd`        | `(agent_id, new_price)`                                  |
//! | `update_reputation` / `batch_update_reputation` | `rep_upd` | `agent_id`, `score`, `updated_at`            |
